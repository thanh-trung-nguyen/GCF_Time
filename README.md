This repository contains MATLAB codes for testing the globally convex functional inverse method for 
estimating the main coefficient (dielectric permittivity) in the wave equation from a time-dependent measurement. 

This method is described in our paper "Recovering dielectric constants of explosives via a globally strictly 
convex cost functional" by MV Klibanov, NT Thành, SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, vol 75(2), pages 518–537, 2015.
